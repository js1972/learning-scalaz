[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good][tt] says:

> A typeclass is a sort of interface that defines some behaviour. If a type is a part of a typeclass, that means that it supports and implements the behavior the typeclass describes.

[Scalaz][z7] says:

> It provides purely functional data structures to complement those from the Scala standard library. It defines a set of foundational type classes (e.g. `Functor`, `Monad`) and corresponding instances for a large number of data structures.

Let's see if I can learn Scalaz by learning me a Haskell.
