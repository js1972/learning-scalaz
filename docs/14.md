[Yesterday][day13] we looked at what `import scalaz._` and `Scalaz._` bring into the scope, and also talked about a la carte style import. Knowing how instances and syntax are organized prepares us for the next step, which is to hack on Scalaz.

### mailing list

Before we start hacking on a project, it's probably good idea to join [its Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scalaz).

### No longer required

The changes on this day are already part of Scalaz 7.1.x.
